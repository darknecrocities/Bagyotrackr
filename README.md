## 🌪️ TyphoonGuard – Disaster Safety in Your Hands

=================================================

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
TyphoonGuard is a full-featured mobile application built with Flutter that provides real-time typhoon alerts, safety guides, AI assistance, and emergency tools tailored for Filipino communities. As climate change continues to intensify weather disturbances, TyphoonGuard aims to bridge the gap between citizens and critical information, empowering users to stay safe, prepared, and informed during typhoons and severe weather events.

=================================================

## 📌 INSPIRATION
--------------
The Philippines, being in the Pacific typhoon belt, experiences an average of 20 typhoons each year. With the increasing frequency and severity of storms, many communities still rely on traditional, delayed, or fragmented channels for warnings and updates. TyphoonGuard was conceptualized to provide a centralized, accessible, and user-friendly mobile app that uses modern technology to help citizens monitor weather threats, prepare ahead of time, and take informed action.
